# iShop-Mern-App -  MERN E-Commerce Application

This is a full-stack E-commerce web application built using the **MERN stack** — MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.  
The project focuses on building a scalable e-commerce platform with authentication, authorization, and a modern UI.

This repository also reflects my learning journey as I migrated the frontend from **Create React App (CRA)** to **Vite**, and later redesigned the UI using **Tailwind CSS**.
